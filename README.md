# A Simple Prolog II Compiler-Interpreter 
A simple Prolog II compiler-interpreter written in Pascal

## Overview
I wrote this program as a course assignment, back in 1988, when I was a student at the University of Aix-Marseilles II, pursuing a MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics ("Diplôme d'Études Approfondies en Informatique et Mathématique"). The course, entitled "Prolog II", was taught by the late [Alain Colmerauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Colmerauer).

## Compilation

The program was developed in [Turbo Pascal 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal#Version_3). Turbo Pascal 3.02 is [provided](https://web.archive.org/web/20101124092418/http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20792) to the Borland community free of charge, as a [zip file] (https://web.archive.org/web/20110815014726/http://altd.embarcadero.com/download/museum/tp302.zip).
